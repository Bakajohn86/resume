    <h1>John Ortiz</h1>
    <p><em>Scrum Master at <strong><a href="https://www.suprtek.com/">SuprTek</a></strong>.</em></p>
    <p>Hello and welcome! I am an Air Force Veteran with over 16 years in the Department of Defense. Through the years I have performed various roles and managed countless programs, ranging from Security/law enforcement, Logistics, Procurement, Information Technology, asset management, cybersecurity, C21 Aircraft scheduling, and much more. I've had the pleasure of working with the best organizations which allowed me to train, mentor, and supervise the finest men and women from all around the globe. Over the years I have worked in countless states and countries which has assisted me in acquiring a vast set of skills and knowledge in numerous fields. After leaving active duty Air Force in 2016, I decided to finally take my education seriously and pursued bachelors in Business Administration. Along the way I started to focus more on where I wanted to be and what I wanted to do, so I shifted my focus heavily on Information Technology and my current goal is to further my skills in the Agile realm and learn more of the software DevOps side. When I'm outside of work I'm usually with my son or spending time with family. As a hobby I enjoy photography, videography, and all forms of art. Hopefully this gives you an idea of who I am and how I can help be an asset to your team.</p>
